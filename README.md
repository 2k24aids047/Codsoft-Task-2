TASK 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Project Description

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player plays against an AI opponent.
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, which makes it very difficult to beat.

This project helps in understanding game logic, decision making, and basic search algorithms.

Features

Human vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe game

3×3 board displayed in the terminal

Player can choose X or O

AI uses Minimax algorithm

Alpha-Beta Pruning for better performance

AI makes smart and optimal moves

Option to play multiple rounds

Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries:

math

random

How It Works

The game starts by showing board positions (0–8).

The human player selects X or O.

Turns are decided randomly.

The human enters a move number.

The AI calculates the best move using the Minimax algorithm.

The game ends when there is a win or a tie.

The player can choose to play again.

How to Run the Program

Make sure Python is installed.

Download or clone the repository.

Open the Task 2 folder.

Run the file using:

python tic_tac_toe_ai.py


Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

Example Gameplay

Human chooses: X

AI chooses: O

Human enters move: 4

AI plays a smart move automatically

Game ends with win, loss, or tie
